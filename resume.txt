Overview:

There is a large untapped and unspoken niche that desperately needs to be filled in America, and worldwide. Black African decendants need dedicated infrastructure 
where we can speak our truth, and abolish the lies that our colonizers and conqurers have told to us, and that many of us still subscribe to.  The lies of inferiority and
the idea that mediocre is good enough (In other words, the spiritualization of poverty) needs to become ideas of the past.  Thanks to the great work of the 
crypto community, this goal is within reach. My goal is to reshape my narrative, and empower specifically African/Black people and broadly all people who want a
voice, but are strategically denied.  Blockchain technology, decentralization, NFTs (ownership) are the antidote to these historical poisions..  
My ultimate goal is to move to Africa and spread knowledge of crypto and directly facilitate the creation
of new economies based on creativity, inclusion, and instead of the traditional big-tech based "how fast can you write this crazy algorithm that you would never write in the real world... not fast enough and I now demote you to "factory worker".  I am willing to let my place go into foreclosure and record my content from an under a bridge before I take another minimum wage factory job, or bow to Jesus like my previous generations were forced to do.  The great resignation is real, and if my White countrymen/women are quitting in record numbers, imagine the conversations that Blacks are quietly having!

tl;dr someone "disrupted" my economy, and it is only fair that I use my MIND and technology to "disrupt" theirs in return.


Being Afro and having been raised in rural USA, I also believe that these ideas apply to ALL humans regardless of the labeling that society, however, these ideas
are mercilessly weaponized in the most sneaky ways against people who "look like me", and the results speak for themselves based on my observations and experiences.
I took it upon myself to create a space where all people (More specifically people who "look like me" and people who are treated like they "look like me") can
have their voices heard in an immutable and permanant way.  No one should be forced to live within the shackles of someone elses misinformation and judgement.
My goal in this project is to directly oppose outdated legacy narratives by verifyable actions not words.  Further, I want this story to be
in as many people's faces so that society can see that there are some (such as myself) who are willing to risk their lives, family, and reputation to speak up.
