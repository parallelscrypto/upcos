Overview:

There is a large untapped and unspoken niche that desperately needs to be filled in America, and worldwide. Black African decendants need dedicated infrastructure 
where we can speak our truth, and abolish the lies that our colonizers and conqurers have told to us, and that many of us still subscribe to.  The lies of inferiority and
the idea that mediocre is good enough (In other words, the spiritualization of poverty) needs to become ideas of the past.  Thanks to the great work of the 
crypto community, this goal has been achieved, because UPC Band Radio is the most timely NFT operating system solution that the entire NFT market has ever seen in recorded history!
My goal is to reshape my narrative, and empower specifically African/Black people and broadly all people who want a
voice, but are strategically denied.  Blockchain technology, decentralization, NFTs (ownership) are the antidote to these historical poisons.  
My ultimate goal is to move to Africa and create jobs by spreading knowledge of crypto, Web3, and NFTs. In other words, I aim to to directly facilitate the creation
of new economies based on creativity, inclusion, and mutual respect instead of constantly competing in the cut throat Web2 centralized "How fast can you write this silly algorithm that you would never write in the real world... not fast enough and I now demote thou to factory worker. Amen" economy.  I refuse to take another minimum wage factory job, or rely on a centralized diety like my previous generations were indoctrinated to do.  The great resignation is real, and if the majority countrymen/women are quitting their jobs, loudly, and in record numbers, imagine the conversations that the minorities are "quietly" having.

tl;dr someone "disrupted" my economy, and it is only fair that I use my creativity, my MIND and technology to "disrupt" theirs in return.


Being Afro and having been raised in rural USA, I also believe that these ideas apply to ALL humans regardless of the labeling that society, however, these ideas
are mercilessly weaponized with extreme tactical precision against people who look like me, and the results speak for themselves.
I took it upon myself to create a space where all people (More specifically people who look like me and people who are treated like they look like me) can
have their voices heard in an immutable and permanant way.  No one should be forced to live within the confines of someone elses misinformation or judgement.
My goal in this project is to directly oppose outdated legacy narratives by verifyable actions instead of only talking about it.  Further, I want the stories, characters, plays and skits,
exclusive interviews, and human creativity in the face of opposition to be  in as many people's faces so that society can see that there are some (such as myself) who are willing 
to risk their lives, family, and reputation to speak up, tell their truth, and think for themselves.
